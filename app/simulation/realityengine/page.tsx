            Reality Engine is Spaceborn&apos;s high-fidelity simulation
            environment designed to recreate the physical world with exceptional
            realism for autonomous systems development. It serves as the foundation
            upon which developers can safely design, test, validate, and optimize
            intelligent machines before they are deployed into real-world
            environments. By accurately simulating physics, terrain, weather,
            lighting, and sensor behavior, Reality Engine enables organizations to
            reduce development risks while accelerating innovation.

            Developing autonomous systems requires extensive testing under
            countless operating conditions, many of which are difficult, expensive,
            or unsafe to reproduce in reality. Reality Engine bridges this gap by
            creating digital environments that closely mimic real-world scenarios.
            Whether simulating dense urban landscapes, remote industrial
            facilities, forests, deserts, airports, or disaster zones, the platform
            provides a realistic environment where autonomous machines can safely
            learn, adapt, and improve their performance.

            At its core, Reality Engine combines advanced physics simulation with
            highly accurate environmental modeling to ensure that every interaction
            behaves as expected. Vehicles respond to terrain conditions, sensors
            experience realistic noise and interference, weather affects visibility
            and navigation, and environmental objects interact according to
            physical laws. This level of fidelity allows developers to confidently
            evaluate navigation algorithms, perception systems, mission planning
            strategies, and autonomous decision-making before any hardware leaves
            the laboratory.
